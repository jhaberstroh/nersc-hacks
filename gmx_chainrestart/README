Chain-restart qsub script for gromacs on NERSC
================================================================================
NOTE 1: .cfg file is sourced as a bash script. This means that you can reference
previous variables within the cfg script. However, make sure you trust the file 
before executing any potentially malicious code!
NOTE 2: This script assumes that all files in the OLDGRO folder (eg .cpt file)
have the same basename as OLDGRO. For example, "npt.gro" and "npt.cpt". This
script will create files that follow this protocol. Rename your existing files 
to use this script if this protocol is not adhered to.
NOTE 3: All gromacs files created with this method will be given the filename
base of $GMX__MDP, but they will be contained in GMX__OUTDIR.
